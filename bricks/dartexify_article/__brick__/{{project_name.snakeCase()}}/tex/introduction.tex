\section{Introduction}
Dart is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. The programming language can be used to develop web and mobile apps as well as server and desktop applications.
It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. It can compile to either machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and type inference.\cite{enwiki:1155641282}

\subsection{What is Dart known for?\cite{dart:dev}}
Dart is known for the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Optimized for UI}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mature and complete async-await for user interfaces containing event-driven code, paired with isolate-based concurrency.
        \item A programming language optimized for building user interfaces with features such as sound null safety, the spread operator for expanding collections, and collection if for customizing UI for each platform.
        \item A programming language that is easy to learn, with a familiar syntax.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Productive development}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Make changes to your source code iteratively, using hot reload to instantly see the effect in the running app
        \item Write code using a flexible type system with rich static analysis and powerful, configurable tooling
        \item Do profiling, logging, and debugging with your code editor of choice
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fast on all platforms}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AOT-compile apps to native machine code for instant startup
        \item Target the web with complete, mature, fast compilers for JavaScript
        \item Run backend code supporting your app, written using a single programming language
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
